# Buycar - Car Dealership Spring MVC App
Java, Spring, JSP, Bootstrap, Hibernate, MySQL, JQuery | Editor used: Eclipse JEE

## Description
A prototype of a car dealership web app. 
Import buycar.sql to server before running the app to load initial database. Otherwise blank database is going to be created with hibernate.

Update: This project uses some outdated techniques which i wanted to practice during my studies.
        I tried avoiding Spring Boot (except for Entity configuration). Project structure is mostly done using xml configuration 
        
## TODO list
* ExceptionHandler
* Order Exception Redirecting
* Double check on server side if uploaded image is jpg
* Admin functionality - delete or block user, block advertisment
* show seller profile page to anonymus users
